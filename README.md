# Visualization of Probability Distributions

This project aims to develop an interactive and educational web application that makes complex statistical distributions easier to understand. By enabling users to adjust parameters dynamically and see the effects in real-time, this tool bridges theoretical concepts with practical applications.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment**: Users can change parameters on the fly and instantly visualize how they impact the distribution.
- **Multi-Distribution Exploration**: The platform includes several key probability distributions, such as:
  - **Normal Distribution**
  - **Binomial Distribution**
  - **Poisson Distribution**
  - **Exponential Distribution**
  - **Uniform Distribution**
  - **Geometric Distribution**
  - **Beta Distribution**
  - **Chi-Square Distribution**
- **Side-by-Side Comparisons**: Compare multiple distributions simultaneously for a better understanding of their unique behaviors.
- **Text File Uploads**: Upload data files and work directly with your own data.
- **Interactive Sliders**: Easily adjust distribution parameters to see real-time effects on the graphs.

## Objective

This application provides a comprehensive platform for exploring various probability models, enhancing user experience and promoting a deeper understanding of statistical distributions.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the application
- **CSS**: Styling for a visually appealing and intuitive interface
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality and interactivity
- **Plotly.js**: Advanced data visualization, enabling dynamic and responsive plots
